rta_fp	A7/A8		Frame (procedure) pointer. rta_fp points into the header of the current procedure. Each procedure header has the form:

0A7: 7E 
0A8: EE 7E E0 00 00 27 10 14 
0B0: 01 00 00 00 01 41 7E E6 
0B8: 00 00 00 00 00 11 00 00 









Global name table
Indirection table for externals/parameters
This is followed by the variables, and finally by the Q code. rta_fp points at the previous rta_fp, so it is easy to jump up through all the procedures above. The language uses this when resolving external references and when handling errors.
